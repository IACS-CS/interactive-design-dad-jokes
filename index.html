      <h3>How the Bowline Works:</h3>
      <p>
        The Bowline creates a <strong>fixed loop</strong> at the end of a rope. 
        Unlike a slip knot, the loop will not tighten or loosen - it stays the 
        same size. This makes it perfect for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tying a rope to a ring or post</li>
        <li>Creating a loop for climbing</li>
        <li>Securing sails on boats</li>
        <li>Any situation where you need a dependable, fixed loop</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How to Tie a Bowline:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Make a small loop</strong> in the main part of the rope (not the end)</li>
        <li><strong>Thread the working end</strong> (the loose end) up through the loop</li>
        <li><strong>Wrap it around the main line</strong> behind and back down</li>
        <li><strong>Push it back through the loop</strong> from the same side it came up</li>
        <li><strong>Pull tight</strong> on the working end and main line</li>
        <li>The loop at the top is now your <strong>fixed, non-slip loop</strong></li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>Tip:</strong> A common saying is "The rabbit comes out of the hole, 
      around the tree, and back down the hole" - this describes the motion of the rope!</p>

      </pre>

      <h3>How the Sheet Bend Works:</h3>
      <p>
        The Sheet Bend is used to join two ropes of the same or different
        thickness. It works by making a simple bend in one rope and then
        passing the end of the second rope through and around that bend.
        When tightened, the ropes pinch together and hold securely under
        tension. It's especially good for tying ropes of different diameters.
      </p>

      <h3>How to Tie a Sheet Bend:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Form a simple bend</strong> (a U-shape) with the thicker or
            main rope; hold the bend so the ends point away from you.</li>
        <li><strong>Pass the working end</strong> of the second (shorter) rope
            up through the bend from behind.</li>
        <li><strong>Wrap it around</strong> the outside of the bend once, then
            tuck it under where it came through.</li>
        <li><strong>Pull both standing ends</strong>—the knot will snug up and
            hold. For extra security, use a Double Sheet Bend by wrapping the
            short end around the bend twice before tucking.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use a Double Sheet Bend when the ropes are
      very different thicknesses or when extra security is needed.</p>

      <h2>The Back Splice (End Finish)</h2>

     /___________\
    (end is finished to prevent fraying)
      </pre>

      <h3>How the Back Splice Works:</h3>
      <p>
        A Back Splice finishes the end of a twisted rope by unlaying the
        strands and weaving them back into the standing part. This creates a
        tidy, bulky end that resists fraying and holds together without heat
        or whipping. It's commonly used on natural-fiber and some synthetic
        ropes when a permanent, neat finish is needed.
      </p>

      <h3>How to Tie a Back Splice (basic steps):</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Unlay</strong> the rope end a short distance (separate the strands).</li>
        <li><strong>Form a small loop</strong> in the standing part for each strand to pass through.</li>
        <li><strong>Weave each strand</strong> back into the rope: pass a strand over and under the adjacent strand(s), following the lay of the rope.</li>
        <li><strong>Tighten</strong> each tuck snugly and trim any excess if needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Dress the splice</strong> by smoothing the strands so the finish is neat and compact.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Practice on scrap rope first — a back splice is tidy and durable, but the technique varies slightly with rope size and construction.</p>
